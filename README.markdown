# FetLife Demographics

The FetLife Demographics user script displays a demographic breakdown of profiles that have RSVP'ed "yes" to a [FetLife.com](https://fetlife.com/) event, providing an at-a-glance view of who may be participating in the event. 

## System requirements

To use the FetLife Demographics user script, you must be running [Mozilla Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) (version 12.0 or higher), with the [Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) installed (at version 1.0 or higher).

Sorry, FetLife Demographics is currently [incompatible with other Web browsers](https://github.com/meitar/fetlife-demographics/issues/1). (Please help me fix that!)
